# Rush-HD-ORR-Extension
Extension pack for the Rush-HD artworks.
This contains the HD Card pictures for all cards in the Over Rush Rare rarity.

### What is "ORR-Extension" ?

"ORR" stands for "Over Rush Rare", a rarity of cards where artworks go *over* the border to essentially make full-art cards.
This is called "Extension" because it is meant to be an extension of the existing [HD pictures](https://github.com/Yoshi80/Rush-HD-Pictures) project.

The only cards covered by this extension are cards who are officially released in this rarity.
